# Faster Than Green

Faster Than Green is a fast-paced mobile game that tests your reaction time and accuracy. The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible by tapping only the green squares on a 5x5 grid. The game starts with a 5x5 grid with 12 green squares positioned randomly, and when you tap a **green square**, a **red square** turns into a green one and the one you pressed becomes a red one. Be careful not to tap the red squares, as they will subtract 1 point from your score. The game ends when 20 seconds pass. 

The web version was made in pure HTML, CSS, JS as a base idea for the react native version (that i lost ðŸ˜­).
In the web version there is an online leaderboard (made for learning firebase) and more game mechanics as the **gold square**, that shows up randomly for few milliseconds and gives you 5 points, and **grey squares** that removes 5 seconds, making the game funnier and more fast peaced in the last seconds.
All this idea, sooner or later, they will come in the react native version (that i really don't know where it is ðŸ¥²).
