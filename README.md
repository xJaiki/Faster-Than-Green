# Faster Than Green - React Native version

Faster Than Green is a fast-paced mobile game that tests your reaction time and accuracy. The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible by tapping only the green squares on a 5x5 grid. The game starts with a 5x5 grid with 12 green squares positioned randomly, and when you tap a green square, a red square turns into a green one and the one you pressed becomes a red one. Be careful not to tap the red squares, as they will subtract 1 point from your score. The game ends when 20 seconds pass. This game is designed as a learning tool for React Native.

# Faster Than Green - web version

The web version was is made in pure HTML, CSS, JS as a base idea for the react native version. This version is richer of the react native version in terms of features and design.
It has a more colorful design, an online leaderboard (made for learning firebase) and more game mechanics as the gold square, that shows up randomly for few milliseconds and gives you 5 points, and grey squares that removes 5 seconds, making the game funnier and more fast peaced in the last seconds.
All this idea, sooner or later, they will come in the react native version.
