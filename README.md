# Faster Than Green - React Native version

Faster Than Green is a fast-paced mobile game that tests your reaction time and accuracy. The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible by tapping only the green squares on a 5x5 grid. The game starts with a 5x5 grid with 12 green squares positioned randomly, and when you tap a green square, a red square turns into a green one and the one you pressed becomes a red one. Be careful not to tap the red squares, as they will subtract 1 point from your score. The game ends when 20 seconds pass. This game is designed as a learning tool for React Native.
